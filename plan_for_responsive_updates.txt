Information Gathered:
- The CSS file assets/css/style.css contains a comprehensive set of styles including custom properties, resets, reusable styles, and media queries for various screen widths.
- Media queries for max-width 768px and 480px adjust hero section and font sizes, but other sections like navigation menu, instruction cards, restaurant cards, and footer may need further responsive adjustments.
- The HTML file index.html includes the correct viewport meta tag and semantic structure.
- Navigation menu includes buttons for open/close menu, indicating a mobile menu toggle is intended.
- Images use width and height attributes and "w-100" class for responsive scaling.

Plan:
1. CSS Updates (assets/css/style.css):
   - Enhance media queries for max-width 768px and 480px to:
     - Adjust navigation menu layout for mobile (e.g., full screen overlay, vertical menu)
     - Stack grid lists (instruction cards, restaurant cards, footer lists) into single columns on small screens
     - Adjust padding and margins for smaller screens to avoid cramped layout
     - Ensure buttons and links are easily tappable on mobile
     - Make images scale properly within their containers
   - Add transitions or animations for mobile menu toggle if needed
   - Fix any fixed widths or heights that break responsiveness on mobile

2. HTML Updates (index.html):
   - Verify and if needed add ARIA attributes for accessibility on mobile menu toggle buttons
   - Ensure the mobile menu toggle buttons have proper data attributes and aria-labels (already present)
   - Confirm the overlay div for mobile menu is correctly placed and styled (mostly CSS)
   - No major structural changes expected, mostly CSS-driven responsiveness

Dependent Files to be Edited:
- assets/css/style.css
- index.html (minor updates if needed for accessibility or mobile menu toggle)

Follow-up Steps:
- Test the site on various screen sizes including mobile phones and tablets
- Verify the mobile menu toggle works correctly and overlays the content
- Check that all sections stack properly and text/images scale well
- Adjust further if any layout issues are found during testing

Please confirm if I can proceed with this plan to update the CSS and HTML files for improved mobile responsiveness.
